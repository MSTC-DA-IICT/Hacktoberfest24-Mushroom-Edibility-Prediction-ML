    "### Image Colorization\n",
    "Implement a model that can perform image colorization, transforming grayscale images into colorized versions using advanced deep learning techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "Create and train deep learning model that accurately convert grayscale images into their colorized counterparts, enhancing visual information and improving the quality of image representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tasks\n",
    "- Data Cleaning & Transformation: Preprocessing the provided dataset of color images to generate grayscale images for model training.\n",
    "- Feature Engineering: Enhance the dataset through techniques such as data augmentation.\n",
    "- Encoding of images into appropriate formats for model compatibility, using libraries like `PIL` for image loading.\n",
